PROPER™ — Semantic Rich Text Editor
==================

PROPER is a Semantic Texteditor based on HTML's `contenteditable` attribute. It's being developed in the context of [Substance](http://github.com/michael/substance), a data driven document authoring engine.

The goal is to output proper semantic HTML by restricting the set of possible tags. When pasting content, the markup is stripped.
