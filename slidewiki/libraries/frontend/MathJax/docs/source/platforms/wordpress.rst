Installing MathJax in WordPress
===============================

Note that there is a `WordPress plugin for MathJax
<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mathjax-latex/>`_, so that may be a
better choice than editing the theme directly.

1. Open the WordPress admin interface.

2. In the administration menu on the left, open up the `Appearance`
   menu and click on the `Editor` submenu option.
 
     .. image:: ../images/wp_menu.png
 
   When you click on the editor option, WordPress should open up the
   first stylesheet in the current theme.
 
3. In the template list on the right side of the page, click on the
   header file (it should be ``header.php``).
 
     .. image:: ../images/wp_templates.png
 
   This part depends slightly on how your current theme is written.
   In the ``header.php`` file, look for the end-of-head tag,
   ``</head>``. If you find it, insert

   .. code-block:: html

       <script type="text/javascript" 
          src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
       </script>

   just before that.  Otherwise, insert the same code at the very
   bottom of the file.
 
4. Save the file.  This will enable MathJax with both TeX and MathML
   input, so you should be able to start adding mathematical content to
   your pages.  If you need to adjust the configuration, see
   :ref:`Configuring MathJax <loading>` for more details.
