SlideWiki --Authoring platform for OpenCourseWare
=========
SlideWiki empowers communities of instructors, teachers, lecturers, academics to create, share and re-use sophisticated educational content in a truly collaborative way. In addition to importing PowerPoint presentations, it supports authoring of interactive online slides using HTML and LaTeX. Slides and their containers (called decks), are versioned, thereby enabling change tracking. Users can create their own themes on top of existing themes or re-use other's themes.
